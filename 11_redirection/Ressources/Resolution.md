# Finding 11 - redirection


## Exploitability
Easy. Only need to inspect page and add modification.


## Risk level/type
OWASP top 10 :
- A01:2021 â€“ Broken Access Control
	=> "Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests."


Common Weakness Enumeration:

CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html


## Detailed description of the exploit
Inspect any of the redirection icons.
Change its value (facebook/twitter/instagram) to something else (does not have to exist)
Without reloading, just click on the icon.
We get to a page that shows:
"Good Job Here is the flag : b9e775a0291fed784a2d9680fcfad7edd6b8cdf87648da647aaf4bba288bcab3"


## Remediation
The remedy is quite simple : any redirection should be validated on the server side, using an allowlist rather than a denylist. This mean enforcing secure access in order to be allowed to change the value.
It may also be helpful for users to display a page before redirection, in order to notify them that they will be redirected and where they will be redirected.
