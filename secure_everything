how to secure against SLQ injections
	=> sanitize input (escape special characters...), server-side input validation (whitelisting...)

other issues:
site is only http => need to enforce TLS for ALL pages 

md5 (and sha1) deprecated => use sha2 (like sha256, sha512) or better (see sha3)
all pwd are encrypted, but email-recovery address is in plaintext
