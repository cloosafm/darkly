## Exploitability
Moderately easy. Need specific knowledge about the vulnerability.

## Risk level/type
OWASP top 10
????????????

## Detailed description of the exploit
The local file inclusion consists of injecting code on the URL.
Specifically, path traversal is about trying to access known possible credential paths that are alike in the OS and the site structure.

One such known vulnerability is to add ```/?page=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd``` after the domain name (here, IP address).
So, let's try that. We get to a page that says:
"Congratulaton!! The flag is : b12c4b2cb8094750ae121a676269aa9e2872d07c06e429d25a63196ec1c8c1d0"
